        "answer": "Code I provides affordable API access to OpenAI's Codex model, the same powerful code-generation model used in GitHub Copilot."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is Code I suitable for?",
        "answer": "Code I is perfect for developers seeking cost-effective access to advanced AI code generation. It integrates seamlessly with your existing IDE and development tools without changing your workflow. It supports multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, and more.

      {
        "question": "What if I don't use up my monthly token quota?",
        "answer": "Unused tokens don't go to waste! You can share your API access with friends or team members. We support creating multiple API keys under one account, and you can set individual quotas and expiration times for each API key. Plus members can create up to 10 API keys, and Pro members can create up to 50 API keys."

        "answer": "Code I offers significantly more affordable access to Codex compared to other providers. We've optimized our infrastructure to provide the same high-quality code generation at a fraction of the cost. Plus, our buffered input tokens come with a 90% discount, making repetitive code analysis and refactoring extremely cost-effective."
